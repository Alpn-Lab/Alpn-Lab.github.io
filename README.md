## Our Research Focus

Our research applies addresses the fundamental question of the **"adaptive brain”** by studying the cognitive, computational, and neurobiological basis of (social) learning and decision-making in healthy individuals (across the lifespan), and in psychiatric disorders. We combine an array of approaches including neuroimaging, patient studies and computational modelling (particularly hierarchical Bayesian modelling) with behavioural paradigms inspired by learning theories.
